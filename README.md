# Reveal-heritage-values-and-attributes-from-textual-data_ multi-label text classification model
# Code Overview
Importing Libraries:
We start by importing necessary libraries, including numpy and bert-embedding.

Initializing BERT Embeddings:
We initialize BERT embeddings using BertEmbedding() from the bert_embedding library.

Defining Categories:
We define categories and their representative words in a dictionary. Each category is associated with a list of words.

Words to Categories:
We create a dictionary that maps each word to its corresponding category.

Obtaining Word Embeddings:
We calculate BERT embeddings for the words in the categories and store them in embeddings_index.

Processing Queries:
The process function takes a query as input, tokenizes it, calculates its BERT embedding, and computes cosine similarities with category embeddings. It returns a dictionary of category scores for the query.

Categorizing Words:
We provide an example of how to use the process function to categorize a word based on its semantic meaning.

Category Classification Functions:
ReturnClass2 selects the category with the highest cosine similarity score for a given dictionary of scores.
ReturnClass3 processes a word and returns its category using the process function.


# Example Usage
You can use this code to categorize words based on their semantic similarity to predefined categories. The provided functions make it easy to integrate BERT embeddings and cosine similarity calculations for your own text classification tasks. Feel free to adapt and extend this code for your specific use case.


# Conclusion
This code serves as a basic example of using BERT embeddings and cosine similarity for text classification. It provides a foundation for more advanced natural language processing tasks and can be customized for various applicationS, especifically to reveal the values within texts.
